        <h2>Beyond the MultiplayerAPI</h2>
        <h3>Implementing a client/server architecture in gdscript and godot.</h3>
    </hgroup>

    <p> I've starting playing around with Godot last month. It's been a really fun experience so far.
        The engine is really approachable and enables me to "get up and running" fast, as a newbie game dev.

        I am playing video games since I can remember and once thing I was always curious about, was how
        game-servers works behind the curtain and manage and persists game state as well as bidirectional communication between clients.

    <p>
        I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8D3vEx7NAE">a tutorial</a> on godot networking and got
        a scene synchronized over the network in ~60 minutes. Awesome! The following days I tried to mix and match the code
        to add new features to my game. But the <code>rpc</code> methods and the relay-peer architecture of
        the default <code>MultiplayerAPI</code> is giving me hard times. My mind is so tightly coupled to client/server
        architecture, because I worked in `HTTP` land the majority of my professional life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cross-Calling <code>rpc</code> methods and constantly checking who's the <code>Authority</code> wasn't what I expected.
        It got messy really fast. So I gave up and did some research on how to implement simple message passing with the base
        building blocks <code>ENet</code> provide by the engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before I ditched the <code>MultiplayerAPI</code> completely, I managed a way to send binary data to the host via
